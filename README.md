# CS-210-ProgrammingLanguages

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I created and application designed to teach the power of investments and compound interest. The user has the ability to input data, such as initial investment, interest rates, duration of investment, and additional monthly investments. The application then displays how the money grows with and without the additional monthly investment. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I feel that I did well using object-oriented programming (OOP). My program consists of classes and header files which keeps the amount of code in main() at a minimum.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvments make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could have done a better job with error handling, specifically within main(). The program asks the user if they wish to continue, and prompts for a yes('y') or quit('q'), but doesn't contain error handling in the case of an invalid input. Instead, if any other letter is input, the program closes abruptly. Adding error handling for this scenario would prevent that issue and prevent unintentionally closing the program.

# What pieces of the code did you find the most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of this project was getting the projection screens to display in a way that looks clean and organized. I struggled getting the layout exactly as desired, and overcame this by researching various syntax that allows for easy formatting.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The biggest skill from this project that will be transferable is the use of OOP. OOP is important for producing clean, easily readable code. Another skill is the various functions and formatting that that allow for a smooth running program and clean end-user display. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This was achieved primarily through the use of OOP. Header files and classes make the program easily readable, and also makes it easier to troubleshoot and debug.
